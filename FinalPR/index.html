  <main>  
    <p>Vietnam, a nation in Southeast Asia on the eastern edge of the Indochinese peninsula, had been under French colonial rule since the 19th century.</p>

    <p>During World War II, Japanese forces invaded Vietnam. To fight off both Japanese occupiers and the French colonial administration, political leader Ho Chi Minh—inspired by Chinese and Soviet communism—formed the Viet Minh, or the League for the Independence of Vietnam.</p>
    
    <p>Following its 1945 defeat in World War II, Japan withdrew its forces from Vietnam, leaving the French-educated Emperor Bao Dai in control. Seeing an opportunity to seize control, Ho’s Viet Minh forces immediately rose up, taking over the northern city of Hanoi and declaring a Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) with Ho as president.</p>
  
    <p>Seeking to regain control of the region, France backed Emperor Bao Dai and set up the state of Vietnam in July 1949, with the city of Saigon as its capital.</p>
  
    <p>Both sides wanted the same thing: a unified Vietnam. But while Ho Chi Minh and his supporters wanted a nation modeled after other communist countries, Bao Dai and many others wanted a Vietnam with close economic and cultural ties to the West.</p>
